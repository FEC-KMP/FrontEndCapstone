# Front-End Capstone
This is a Front End Capstone project for which we created the front end of a client-facting retail web-portal based on a requirements doc and a layout. The main features of this project were the Product Overview, Questions and Answers, and Ratings and Review components, of which each of our team members worked on one part.
